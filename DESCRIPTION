Description: Our package is used for estimating the disparity between a majority group and minority group based on the extended model of the Peters-Belson method. Our model is the first work on the longitudinal data, and also can set a varying variable to find the complicated association between other variables and the varying variable. Our work is an extension of the extension of the Peters-Belson method which were originally published in Peters (1941)<doi:10.1080/00220671.1941.10881036> and Belson (1956)<doi:10.2307/2985420>.
